# RAG-Based Lead Scoring System - Project Overview

## 🎯 Project Goal

Build an AI-powered lead scoring system that analyzes new leads against historical successful cases to predict the likelihood of success. The system uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to find similar past wins and generate evidence-based scores.

**Questions to Consider:**
- How many successful cases do you have available?
- What formats are your case files in?
- Do you need any specific case type filtering?
- What's your target timeline for completion?
- Are there any compliance requirements specific to your firm?
