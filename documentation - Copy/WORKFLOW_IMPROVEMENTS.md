# Lead Scoring Workflow Improvements

Strategic enhancements to transform the prototype into a production-ready system.

---

## üéØ Core Workflow Enhancements

### Multi-Dimensional Confidence Scoring
- Break confidence into: liability, damages, evidence, precedent components
- Target specific weak areas for tool usage
- Provide granular transparency to users

### Smart Tool Selection Strategy  
- Identify weak components and select appropriate tools
- Liability issues ‚Üí Search liability-focused cases
- Damage unclear ‚Üí Medical records tool
- Evidence gaps ‚Üí Court records tool
- Precedent weak ‚Üí Deep case summarization

### Iterative Context Building
- Build context progressively rather than replacing
- Layer: base context ‚Üí enhanced context ‚Üí targeted context  
- Weight newer, more specific context higher

---

## üß† Intelligence & Accuracy Improvements

### Case Similarity Scoring Algorithm
- Multi-factor similarity beyond vector search
- Weight: vector similarity (30%) + injury match (25%) + jurisdiction (15%) + case type (15%) + outcome relevance (15%)

### Dynamic Tool Call Limits
- Adaptive limits based on case complexity
- Low confidence (<30%): 8 tools allowed
- Medium confidence (30-50%): 5 tools allowed  
- High confidence (>50%): 3 tools allowed

### Confidence Validation System
- Cross-check AI confidence with historical accuracy
- Adjust confidence based on case complexity factors
- Flag overconfident predictions

---

## üìä Feedback Loop & Learning

### Outcome Tracking & Model Improvement
- Record actual case outcomes vs predictions
- Identify patterns in mispredictions
- Update confidence calibration based on results

### A/B Testing Framework
- Conservative strategy: high threshold, low risk
- Aggressive strategy: low threshold, high coverage
- Balanced strategy: adaptive threshold
- Track which works best for different firms

---

## ‚ö° Performance & Robustness  

### Intelligent Caching
- Cache expensive LLM summaries for reuse
- Cache vector search results for similar lead patterns
- Reduce API costs and improve response times

### Parallel Processing for Complex Cases
- Split analysis into parallel threads: liability, damages, evidence
- Combine results for final confidence check
- Reduce processing time for complex leads

### Error Recovery & Graceful Degradation
- Full analysis ‚Üí Reduced analysis ‚Üí Rule-based ‚Üí Minimal analysis
- Ensure system always provides some result
- Handle API failures, database errors gracefully

## üé® User Experience Enhancements

### Explainable AI Components
- "Why this score": Reference to similar cases and outcomes
- "Key strengths": Clear liability, severe injuries, etc.
- "Key risks": Pre-existing conditions, witness issues, etc.
- "Improvement suggestions": Get medical records, interview witnesses

### Real-time Confidence Indicators
- Show users what AI is thinking during analysis
- "Analyzing similar slip-and-fall cases..."
- "Low confidence - getting more medical precedents..."
- "Found 3 strong comparable cases, confidence increasing..."

### Collaborative Scoring
- Allow attorneys to provide missing context
- Interactive prompts for additional information
- Incorporate human knowledge into AI scoring

## üîç Key Decision Points

**Architecture**: Monolith vs Microservices for initial production?
**Caching Strategy**: Redis, in-memory, or database-based?
**Tool Limits**: Fixed vs dynamic vs user-configurable?
**Confidence Threshold**: 60% vs adaptive based on case complexity?
**Deployment**: Cloud-first vs hybrid vs on-premise options?
