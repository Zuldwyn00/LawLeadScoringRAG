----------------------------------------
**ROLE:** You are a predictive lead scoring engine for a personal injury law firm. Your primary function is to evaluate the viability of new client leads with cold, objective analysis.

**TASK:** Evaluate the provided "New Lead" by comparing it against the "Historical Case Summaries" retrieved from our database. Your goal is to determine the likelihood of a successful outcome for the new lead. A successful outcome is defined as securing a favorable settlement or verdict for the plaintiff..

**CONTEXT:**
1.  **New Lead:** A description of a potential new case.
2.  **Historical Case Summaries:** A list of structured JSON objects in a dict format representing past cases from our firm that have semantic similarities to the new lead. These summaries include both wins and losses, providing a balanced perspective on precedent.

**ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK:**
Follow these steps to construct your analysis:
1.  **Direct Comparison:** For each historical case provided, explicitly compare its key facts (e.g., `case_type`, `injuries_described`, `summary_of_facts`) to the new lead.
2.  **Identify Success Factors:** Based on the historical *wins*, identify the factors in the new lead that align with those successful outcomes. (e.g., "The clear assignment of fault in the police report mirrors Case-A, which was a strong win.").
3.  **Identify Risk Factors:** Based on the historical *losses* (or complicating factors in wins), identify the elements of the new lead that present risks. (e.g., "The client's pre-existing condition is a major risk, similar to the issue that caused us to lose Case-B.").
4.  **Evaluate Evidence Strength:** Assess the apparent strength of the evidence mentioned in the new lead compared to what was critical in past cases (e.g., `critical_evidence`, `witnesses_mentioned`).
5.  **Assess Geographic Influence:** Consider the jurisdiction of the new lead. Using the historical case summaries and your general knowledge of the United States jurisdiction injury case settlement values on average, assess the average $ value of cases in this jurisdiction for this type of case. If no jurisdiction is mentioned, use the average $ value of cases in the state of New York, Long Island.

**MANDATORY ITERATIVE TOOL USAGE PROCESS:**

**YOU MUST FOLLOW THIS EXACT WORKFLOW:**

1. **Initial Assessment**: Evaluate the provided historical context and determine if you need additional information from case files to provide a thorough analysis

2. **Tool Call Execution**: 
** CRITICAL: YOUR INITIAL RESPONSE MUST INCLUDE AT LEAST 2 TOOL CALLS SIMULTANEOUSLY. THIS IS MANDATORY FOR PROPER ANALYSIS.
   - **MULTIPLE TOOL CALLS REQUIRED**: You MUST make 2-3 tool calls in your first response. This is not optional.
   - **PARALLEL INVESTIGATION**: Call multiple relevant case files simultaneously to gather comprehensive evidence
   - **INTELLIGENT BATCHING**: You can make MULTIPLE tool calls in a single response when they serve related analysis goals
   - **STRATEGIC APPROACH**: Batch calls when you need complementary information (e.g., similar cases + jurisdiction precedents), but use sequential calls when one result will inform what to investigate next
   - Do NOT make a tool call to the same file multiple times, only once per file.
   - Make tool calls to gather additional information from case files
   - Target specific case files using the exact "source" field paths from historical context
   - **EXAMPLES**: Batch 2-3 similar outcome cases together, OR make 1 call to understand a complex case before deciding what other files to examine
   - **SYSTEM TOOL USAGE MESSAGES**: You will receive system messages indicating how many tool calls you have used and how many remain (e.g., "X out of Y"). Use this information to decide an appropriate batch size for your next round and track your usage based on these messages.

3. **Continue or Finalize**: 
   - **CONTINUE INVESTIGATING**: If you need more information, make additional tool calls using intelligent batching
   - **SYSTEM WILL GUIDE YOU**: The system will tell you when to provide your final analysis - respond to those instructions immediately
   - **TOOL USAGE REMINDERS**: System messages may state your current tool usage (e.g., "your tool usage count is at X out of Y"). Use these reminders to plan subsequent batches; do not maintain your own counters.
   - **RESPOND TO SYSTEM MESSAGES**: When you receive a system message instructing you to finalize, provide your complete analysis

**GOOD TOOL CALL TARGETS:**
* Case files with relevant outcomes (wins/losses) similar to your lead
* Cases from the same jurisdiction with settlement data
* Cases with similar injury types or liability scenarios
* Files that contain contradictory information needing clarification
* **SMART BATCHING STRATEGY**: 
  - Batch complementary files (e.g., 2-3 similar successful cases from same jurisdiction)
  - Use sequential calls when one result will guide your next investigation
  - Make thoughtful decisions about how many files to investigate in each round


**REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Provide your response as a single, complete analysis. Do not output any other text. Your response must follow this structure exactly:

---
**Lead Score:** [Provide a numerical score from 1 to 100, where 1 is extremely low potential and 100 is extremely high potential] format it as: "Lead Score: 0/100"
**Confidence Score:** [Provide a numerical confidence score from 1 to 100 indicating how confident you are in your lead score assessment] format it as: "Confidence Score: 0/100"
**Jurisdiction:** [Provide the jurisdiction/county for this case] format it as: "Jurisdiction: [County Name]"
**Recommendation:** [Provide a one-sentence summary of your recommendation. These are just some examples, you can be more creative with your recommendation. e.g., "High-potential case, recommend immediate follow-up.", "Medium-potential case with significant risks requiring further investigation.", or "Low-potential case, recommend declining."]

**Executive Summary:**
[Provide a brief, one-paragraph summary of your overall analysis and the primary reasons for your recommendation.]

**Detailed Rationale:**

**1. Positive Indicators (Alignment with Past Successes):**
*   [List specific factors in the new lead that are similar to successful historical cases. Reference the `case_id` when possible. Example: "- The clear, immediate medical diagnosis of a torn meniscus aligns with the successful outcome in Case-2022-042."]

**2. Negative Indicators & Risk Factors (Alignment with Past Losses/Challenges):**
*   [List specific factors in the new lead that are similar to historical losses or present known challenges. Reference the `case_id` when possible. Example: "- The client's pre-existing arthritis is a significant hurdle, mirroring the primary defense argument that led to a loss in Case-2021-015."]

**3. Strength of Precedent:**
[Provide a concluding sentence on how strong and relevant the provided historical cases are as precedents for this new lead.]

**4. Geographic & Jurisdictional Analysis:**
*   [Provide an analysis of the Jurisdiction. Based on your general training data, comment on whether this jurisdiction is favorable or unfavorable to plaintiffs and provide a number range for the average $ amount value of these kinds of cases in this jurisdiction.]

**5. Case ID of cases given in the context:**
*   [List the `Case ID` of the historical cases that were provided in the given context provided in the 'case_id' field. Example: "ID:1050076, ID:3444110"]

**6. Analysis Depth & Tool Usage:**
*   **Tool Calls Made:** [List any tools used with your reasoning: "Round 1: get_file_context(case_file_x.pdf, case_file_y.pdf) - Seeking similar outcome cases; Round 2: get_file_context(case_file_z.pdf) - Following up on jurisdiction question"]
*   **Information Gained:** [Explain how each tool call or batch enhanced your understanding and analysis]
*   **Overall Evidence Strength:** [Rate your confidence in the evidence base: Low/Moderate/High/Very High]

Potential client – Nassau County slip-and-fall. A 52-year-old office manager was attending a corporate holiday party at the Marriott Hotel in Garden City on December 15th at approximately 8:30 PM. The event was held in the hotel's main ballroom, which had been decorated with holiday lights and garlands. The plaintiff alleges she slipped on a wet spot near the bar area and fell, sustaining a fractured left wrist and torn rotator cuff in her right shoulder. She was taken by ambulance to Nassau University Medical Center where she underwent surgery to repair the wrist fracture with internal fixation. The shoulder injury required arthroscopic surgery three weeks later. She was out of work for 8 weeks and has ongoing physical therapy. The plaintiff claims the hotel failed to properly maintain the floor and should have had warning signs or mats in the bar area. However, security camera footage shows the plaintiff had consumed several cocktails over the course of the evening, and witnesses reported she appeared to be unsteady on her feet before the fall. The hotel maintains they had proper floor maintenance protocols in place, including regular inspections every 30 minutes, and that the wet spot was created by other patrons' spilled drinks, not by hotel negligence. The plaintiff's blood alcohol content was 0.12% when tested at the hospital. Additionally, the plaintiff was wearing high-heeled shoes with smooth soles, which the defense will argue contributed to the fall. The hotel has offered a $25,000 settlement, but the plaintiff's attorney believes the case is worth $150,000 given the surgeries and lost wages. The case hinges on whether the hotel had constructive notice of the dangerous condition and whether the plaintiff's own negligence was a substantial factor in causing her injuries.

She has been known by the a/k/a Gina Martine for her work.  She lives with her daughter, Chelsea, at her current address.  She has a grandson that lives with the dad in CT.  

Prior to her current apt, she lived at 178 West Yaphank Road, Coram.  She lived there from 4/1/2020 through ________.  She had an Asian, male roommate for 3 months, Thomas Graphio. He moved out due to an issue with the cesspool.  He lived there before her.  He moved out in July 2020.   Her daughter stayed with her in March of 2021, after that accident, to help her.  She stayed until they both left.  

There was a colony of cats in the backyard, approx. 30.  They were feral cats.  She would take care of the cats.  She started in July/Aug of 2020.  She told the landlord that she had them all fixed, neutered and spayed.  The cats were going through the garbage cans so she started giving them food.  She fed them 2x a day.  She would feed them wet and dry food.  Before her injury, she fed them by an outside table and chairs.  After her accident, she had to feed them on the steps because she could not get up the steps.  She used maybe 6 bowls in the beginning to feed the cats.  At the end, she was using 15 bowls.  

She went to Boces and got a cosmetology degree.  She filed bankruptcy in 1993 and in 2010.

She weighs 160 pounds now.  She gained weight after the accident because her activities were limited.  She could not lift weights or run.  Prior to the accident she went to the gym 3x per week.  She was a member from Bev Fitness Gold gym in Syosset, which closed, and Planet Fitness in Centereach.  She was also a member of Bev Fitness in Garden City.  She was not a member of a gym on the d/a.  She is not a member of a gym now.  She’s a yellow belt in Kempo karate.  She used to loved to dance, but she cannot wear heels, so ow she dances barefoot.

PCP – Dr. Arif.
Her health insurance is Health First through ObamaCare

Facebook – Ginapastina is her username
Instagram – Gina3944 – she only uses for work pictures. 
She deleted Ticktock and Twitter.  She cannot recall her usernames anymore, as its been years.  

She is currently employed.  Tru Salon in St. James, and she is self employed at VS1 Salon in Great Neck.  She has worked at Tru salon since Sept 2021.  She has worked at VS1 for 9 years.
On the d/a, she worked at VS1.   She is a master colorist.  She does not work more than 5 hours in a day because of her ankle.  By the end of the day her ankle is swollen.  She is on her feet for most of her work day.  Prior to the accident, she used to do a lot of clients but the pandemic hurt her business.  She was closed for the pandemic and she reopened her business in May 2020.  In May 2020, she does not know how many clients she would do in a day.  She does not know how many hours she would work in the day.  She was ½ on unemployment and ½ working.  In may 2020, she was not working more than 5 hours a day.  She missed 1 week from work as a result of the accident.  When she went back to work, her daughter had to drive her to work, and she had to use a scooter.  She did her same job but using the scooter.  She could not shampoo clients because she could not get behind the sink.  She used the scooter for 3 and half months.  
She received partial unemployment for about 1 year.  She stopped receiving unemployment in Sept 2021 or 2020, she is unsure.  She cannot say if her income was effected in any way because of the pandemic.

She wears glasses to see up close for reading.  She gets them at the dollar store.  She had her eyes checked by a doctor, maybe Cohen’s Fashion Optical in the Mall.  The last time she was there was 2 years ago.

She resided in a basement apartment.  She entered through a staircase in the backyard.  The apt was a 2 bedroom, storage room, kitchen, hallway, bathroom and washer and dryer.  There was another staircase that went into the house that other tenants lived in.  Her normal means of egress was the outside staircase.  There was a screen door and kitchen door.  The screen door opened out toward the staircase.  The solid door opened into the apt.  There were approx. 6-7 stairs leading to the apt.  They were made of brick.  There was a landing on the bottom made out of ceramic tile.  The landing was maybe 3-4 feet.  The landing at the top of the stairs was either cement or brick.  The last 2 steps above the bottom landing tilted down from back to front, and the landing was concave because it was cracked.  Prior to the accident, she would leave her apt 1-2x a day.  She would use the staircase between 2-4x a day, plus the 2 times a day that she fed the cats.   

Her roommate Thomas would do maintenance work around the apt.  He thought he was the superintendent of the apt. He installed the screen door, installed camera. He took the camera when he left, along with the ring doorbell when he left.  He moved out in July 2020.  

She was involved in an accident on 1/23/21 at the premises.  She was going down the steps, when her foot rolled on the last step and the landing.  Her right ankle rolled on the last step going to the landing.  Her left foot was in the air going down to the landing.  She then specifically said that her right ankle rolled on the last step.  Her right foot was in the middle of the step when her right ankle rolled.  Her body was toward to the left side of the door as she’s facing the door.  Her right and left foot were on the last step together. When she lifted her left foot and put it down on the landing, her right ankle rolled on the step.  She was carrying empty cap bowls in both hands.  Just prior to the accident, she went up the steps and was coming back down when the accident occurred.  

The landlord had told her to get out because she asked the landlord to fix the oven.  She stopped paying rent prior to the accident because her oven was broken and there was damage from the cesspool.  Her rent was $600 at the t/a.  

She had 2 glasses of wine Friday night with her dinner.  She smokes marijuana but was out of it on the day of the accident. She does not recall when she last smoked marijuana prior to the accident.  

She had observed the defects with the steps prior to the accident.  She never made any complaints about the stairs to the landlord.  She was aware of the condition of the steps from going up and down them several times a day.  She was taking precautions walking down the steps by taking the most safe route down the stairs.  The screen door was open at the t/a and so was the interior solid door.  The tilted down steps caused her ankle to roll. She then fell forward on her hands and her knees.  She fell forward into the kitchen of the apt.  Both hands hit the ground and her right knee.  

She yelled help to the people upstair, Jessica and Daryl.  They came down and called an ambulance.

The ambulance arrived.  She told them that she fell down the stairs in the landing area.  She c/o pain to her right ankle.  She was taken to LI Community Hospital.  They did xrays and told her she had a fractured ankle and that she needed to see an orthopedist.  She was given crutches.

She went a few days later to see Dr. Kormylo.  She c/o of pain in her right ankle.  He performed xrays and told her that she needed surgery on her FX ankle.  She had surgery on 1/30/21.  The put her bones back together and put in screws and a plate. A hard cast was put on her ankle.  She was then put in a boot.  After three and half months, she went to PT. 

In between the accident and the surgery, she went to work one day using a scooter for her leg.  She stayed home the rest of the days.  

She saw her cardiologist before the surgery to get clearance.  She has mitral valve prolapse. 

She went to Provident PT in Medford 3x a week for 6 months.  Then insurance would not cover it during that year 2021 so she stopped for 3-4 months.  The following year she did another 6 months.  Then the insurance refused to pay more so she stopped treatment.  She was given exercises to do at home.  

She had an MRI of her foot after the surgery at Zwanger Pesiri because she felt like there something in between her toes.  She was referred by Dr. Kormylo.

Further injections and surgery was recommended by Dr. Kormylo.  He recommended removal of the hardware and cleaning out scar tissue.  She has not had the surgery.  She would like to get it if ever she could take off of work.  

She consulted with an atty the same week of the accident.
In 2014, she suffered broken ribs because she was pushed by an ex boyfriend.  No other accidents.  No prior injuries.  

In 2021, after she stopped wearing her boot, she reinjured her right ankle after the accident because her right ankle rolled. She was walking up a curb into a driveway at the salon.  She went back to Dr. Kormylo.  He did xrays.  Her ankle was fine.  Dr. Kormylo recommended injections.  She did not have them because she did not feel they would help.  Her ankle was healing when this ankle occurred.  She had just started to walk without the boot and PT.  This accident did not make her ankle worse.  

She applied for SSD in 2016 for depression, back pain, fibromyalgia.  She did not use an attorney.  She was not approved.  

Activities-
Cannot do – cannot run, dance.  
Limited – working.  At the end of the day, her ankle swells.  

Her right ankle freezes at night and she needs a cane to walk to the bathroom.  Her pain is 1/10.  Her ankle feels stiff right now.  

Out of pocket expenses – Scooter $275, new car to fit the scooter in.  She bought a Kia Nero for 25k when she traded in her BMW.  

Liens – she does not know

She went to CT in 2022 for a concert, Ginger.  No vacas since the d/a.

Confinement to bed – a few days 
Confinement to home – whenever there were snow storms because the landlord did not shovel.  

Def A – it shows the area.  But it does not show the angle of the steps being tilted.  On the bottom step, in between the 6th and the 7th brick from the right, if where her ankle rolled.  Her foot was either on the 6th or 7th brick or a combination.
Def B – hard to tell that there’s a slant in the steps.  But it is the location on the day of the accident.  Fair and accurate.  Her foot was on the first step.  This looks like her foot was on the 3 or 4th brick.  She believes the bricks that her foot stepped on are depicted in the photos but she cannot tell exactly where.
Def C – not fair and accurate because you cannot see the tilt in the steps.  The brick her right foot was on is depicted in the photo.  Her foot was on the 4th and 5th brick from the right side of the photo on the bottom steps.
Def D – shows how the cats would normally sit on the steps.  

No cats were on the steps when the accident occurred.  In 2020, the cats would sit on the wall of the steps.   

Her scar on her right akle is about 3 and a half inches long.  It makes her less attractive.  People have said “ewww” to her scar before.

EBT MEMO
7/20/23

Gina Covello
D/A: 1/23/21

Reporter US Legal – Justin Ortiz - ortijust26@gmail.com
Def Atty – Louis Imbroto - limbroto@milbermakris.com

She has been known by the a/k/a Gina Martine for her work.  She lives with her daughter, Chelsea, at her current address.  She has a grandson that lives with the dad in CT.  

Prior to her current apt, she lived at 178 West Yaphank Road, Coram.  She lived there from 4/1/2020 through ________.  She had an Asian, male roommate for 3 months, Thomas Graphio. He moved out due to an issue with the cesspool.  He lived there before her.  He moved out in July 2020.   Her daughter stayed with her in March of 2021, after that accident, to help her.  She stayed until they both left.  

There was a colony of cats in the backyard, approx. 30.  They were feral cats.  She would take care of the cats.  She started in July/Aug of 2020.  She told the landlord that she had them all fixed, neutered and spayed.  The cats were going through the garbage cans so she started giving them food.  She fed them 2x a day.  She would feed them wet and dry food.  Before her injury, she fed them by an outside table and chairs.  After her accident, she had to feed them on the steps because she could not get up the steps.  She used maybe 6 bowls in the beginning to feed the cats.  At the end, she was using 15 bowls.  

She went to Boces and got a cosmetology degree.  She filed bankruptcy in 1993 and in 2010.

She weighs 160 pounds now.  She gained weight after the accident because her activities were limited.  She could not lift weights or run.  Prior to the accident she went to the gym 3x per week.  She was a member from Bev Fitness Gold gym in Syosset, which closed, and Planet Fitness in Centereach.  She was also a member of Bev Fitness in Garden City.  She was not a member of a gym on the d/a.  She is not a member of a gym now.  She’s a yellow belt in Kempo karate.  She used to loved to dance, but she cannot wear heels, so ow she dances barefoot.  She last danced 2-3 years ago.  

PCP – Dr. Arif.
Her health insurance is Health First through ObamaCare

Facebook – Ginapastina is her username
Instagram – Gina3944 – she only uses for work pictures. 
She deleted Ticktock and Twitter.  She cannot recall her usernames anymore, as its been years.  

She is currently employed.  Tru Salon in St. James, and she is self employed at VS1 Salon in Great Neck.  She has worked at Tru salon since Sept 2021.  She has worked at VS1 for 9 years.
On the d/a, she worked at VS1.   She is a master colorist.  She does not work more than 5 hours in a day because of her ankle.  By the end of the day her ankle is swollen.  She is on her feet for most of her work day.  Prior to the accident, she used to do a lot of clients but the pandemic hurt her business.  She was closed for the pandemic and she reopened her business in May 2020.  In May 2020, she does not know how many clients she would do in a day.  She does not know how many hours she would work in the day.  She was ½ on unemployment and ½ working.  In may 2020, she was not working more than 5 hours a day.  She missed 1 week from work as a result of the accident.  When she went back to work, her daughter had to drive her to work, and she had to use a scooter.  She did her same job but using the scooter.  She could not shampoo clients because she could not get behind the sink.  She used the scooter for 3 and half months.  
She received partial unemployment for about 1 year.  She stopped receiving unemployment in Sept 2021 or 2020, she is unsure.  She cannot say if her income was effected in any way because of the pandemic.

She wears glasses to see up close for reading.  She gets them at the dollar store.  She had her eyes checked by a doctor, maybe Cohen’s Fashion Optical in the Mall.  The last time she was there was 2 years ago.

She resided in a basement apartment.  She entered through a staircase in the backyard.  The apt was a 2 bedroom, storage room, kitchen, hallway, bathroom and washer and dryer.  There was another staircase that went into the house that other tenants lived in.  Her normal means of egress was the outside staircase.  There was a screen door and kitchen door.  The screen door opened out toward the staircase.  The solid door opened into the apt.  There were approx. 6-7 stairs leading to the apt.  They were made of brick.  There was a landing on the bottom made out of ceramic tile.  The landing was maybe 3-4 feet.  The landing at the top of the stairs was either cement or brick.  The last 2 steps above the bottom landing tilted down from back to front, and the landing was concave because it was cracked.  Prior to the accident, she would leave her apt 1-2x a day.  She would use the staircase between 2-4x a day, plus the 2 times a day that she fed the cats.   

Her roommate Thomas would do maintenance work around the apt.  He thought he was the superintendent of the apt. He installed the screen door, installed camera. He took the camera when he left, along with the ring doorbell when he left.  He moved out in July 2020.  

She was involved in an accident on 1/23/21 at the premises.  She was going down the steps, when her foot rolled on the last step and the landing.  Her right ankle rolled on the last step going to the landing.  Her left foot was in the air going down to the landing.  She then specifically said that her right ankle rolled on the last step.  Her right foot was in the middle of the step when her right ankle rolled.  Her body was toward to the left side of the door as she’s facing the door.  Her right and left foot were on the last step together. When she lifted her left foot and put it down on the landing, her right ankle rolled on the step.  She was carrying empty cap bowls in both hands.  Just prior to the accident, she went up the steps and was coming back down when the accident occurred.  

The landlord had told her to get out because she asked the landlord to fix the oven.  She stopped paying rent prior to the accident because her oven was broken and there was damage from the cesspool.  Her rent was $600 at the t/a.  

She had 2 glasses of wine Friday night with her dinner.  She smokes marijuana but was out of it on the day of the accident. She does not recall when she last smoked marijuana prior to the accident.  

She had observed the defects with the steps prior to the accident.  She never made any complaints about the stairs to the landlord.  She was aware of the condition of the steps from going up and down them several times a day.  She was taking precautions walking down the steps by taking the most safe route down the stairs.  The screen door was open at the t/a and so was the interior solid door.  The tilted down steps caused her ankle to roll. She then fell forward on her hands and her knees.  She fell forward into the kitchen of the apt.  Both hands hit the ground and her right knee.  

She yelled help to the people upstair, Jessica and Daryl.  They came down and called an ambulance.

The ambulance arrived.  She told them that she fell down the stairs in the landing area.  She c/o pain to her right ankle.  She was taken to LI Community Hospital.  They did xrays and told her she had a fractured ankle and that she needed to see an orthopedist.  She was given crutches.

She went a few days later to see Dr. Kormylo.  She c/o of pain in her right ankle.  He performed xrays and told her that she needed surgery on her FX ankle.  She had surgery on 1/30/21.  The put her bones back together and put in screws and a plate. A hard cast was put on her ankle.  She was then put in a boot.  After three and half months, she went to PT. 

In between the accident and the surgery, she went to work one day using a scooter for her leg.  She stayed home the rest of the days.  

She saw her cardiologist before the surgery to get clearance.  She has mitral valve prolapse. 

She went to Provident PT in Medford 3x a week for 6 months.  Then insurance would not cover it during that year 2021 so she stopped for 3-4 months.  The following year she did another 6 months.  Then the insurance refused to pay more so she stopped treatment.  She was given exercises to do at home.  

She had an MRI of her foot after the surgery at Zwanger Pesiri because she felt like there something in between her toes.  She was referred by Dr. Kormylo.

Further injections and surgery was recommended by Dr. Kormylo.  He recommended removal of the hardware and cleaning out scar tissue.  She has not had the surgery.  She would like to get it if ever she could take off of work.  

She consulted with an atty the same week of the accident.
In 2014, she suffered broken ribs because she was pushed by an ex boyfriend.  No other accidents.  No prior injuries.  

In 2021, after she stopped wearing her boot, she reinjured her right ankle after the accident because her right ankle rolled. She was walking up a curb into a driveway at the salon.  She went back to Dr. Kormylo.  He did xrays.  Her ankle was fine.  Dr. Kormylo recommended injections.  She did not have them because she did not feel they would help.  Her ankle was healing when this ankle occurred.  She had just started to walk without the boot and PT.  This accident did not make her ankle worse.  

She applied for SSD in 2016 for depression, back pain, fibromyalgia.  She did not use an attorney.  She was not approved.  

Activities-
Cannot do – cannot run, dance.  
Limited – working.  At the end of the day, her ankle swells.  

Her right ankle freezes at night and she needs a cane to walk to the bathroom.  Her pain is 1/10.  Her ankle feels stiff right now.  

Out of pocket expenses – Scooter $275, new car to fit the scooter in.  She bought a Kia Nero for 25k when she traded in her BMW.  

Liens – she does not know

She went to CT in 2022 for a concert, Ginger.  No vacas since the d/a.

Confinement to bed – a few days 
Confinement to home – whenever there were snow storms because the landlord did not shovel.  

Def A – it shows the area.  But it does not show the angle of the steps being tilted.  On the bottom step, in between the 6th and the 7th brick from the right, if where her ankle rolled.  Her foot was either on the 6th or 7th brick or a combination.
Def B – hard to tell that there’s a slant in the steps.  But it is the location on the day of the accident.  Fair and accurate.  Her foot was on the first step.  This looks like her foot was on the 3 or 4th brick.  She believes the bricks that her foot stepped on are depicted in the photos but she cannot tell exactly where.
Def C – not fair and accurate because you cannot see the tilt in the steps.  The brick her right foot was on is depicted in the photo.  Her foot was on the 4th and 5th brick from the right side of the photo on the bottom steps.
Def D – shows how the cats would normally sit on the steps.  

No cats were on the steps when the accident occurred.  In 2020, the cats would sit on the wall of the steps.   

Her scar on her right akle is about 3 and a half inches long.  It makes her less attractive.  People have said “ewww” to her scar before.

EBT MEMO
7/20/23

Gina Covello
D/A: 1/23/21

Reporter US Legal – Justin Ortiz - ortijust26@gmail.com
Def Atty – Louis Imbroto - limbroto@milbermakris.com

She has been known by the a/k/a Gina Martine for her work.  She lives with her daughter, Chelsea, at her current address.  She has a grandson that lives with the dad in CT.  

Prior to her current apt, she lived at 178 West Yaphank Road, Coram.  She lived there from 4/1/2020 through ________.  She had an Asian, male roommate for 3 months, Thomas Graphio. He moved out due to an issue with the cesspool.  He lived there before her.  He moved out in July 2020.   Her daughter stayed with her in March of 2021, after that accident, to help her.  She stayed until they both left.  

There was a colony of cats in the backyard, approx. 30.  They were feral cats.  She would take care of the cats.  She started in July/Aug of 2020.  She told the landlord that she had them all fixed, neutered and spayed.  The cats were going through the garbage cans so she started giving them food.  She fed them 2x a day.  She would feed them wet and dry food.  Before her injury, she fed them by an outside table and chairs.  After her accident, she had to feed them on the steps because she could not get up the steps.  She used maybe 6 bowls in the beginning to feed the cats.  At the end, she was using 15 bowls.  

She went to Boces and got a cosmetology degree.  She filed bankruptcy in 1993 and in 2010.

She weighs 160 pounds now.  She gained weight after the accident because her activities were limited.  She could not lift weights or run.  Prior to the accident she went to the gym 3x per week.  She was a member from Bev Fitness Gold gym in Syosset, which closed, and Planet Fitness in Centereach.  She was also a member of Bev Fitness in Garden City.  She was not a member of a gym on the d/a.  She is not a member of a gym now.  She’s a yellow belt in Kempo karate.  She used to loved to dance, but she cannot wear heels, so ow she dances barefoot.  She last danced 2-3 years ago.  

PCP – Dr. Arif.
Her health insurance is Health First through ObamaCare

Facebook – Ginapastina is her username
Instagram – Gina3944 – she only uses for work pictures. 
She deleted Ticktock and Twitter.  She cannot recall her usernames anymore, as its been years.  

She is currently employed.  Tru Salon in St. James, and she is self employed at VS1 Salon in Great Neck.  She has worked at Tru salon since Sept 2021.  She has worked at VS1 for 9 years.
On the d/a, she worked at VS1.   She is a master colorist.  She does not work more than 5 hours in a day because of her ankle.  By the end of the day her ankle is swollen.  She is on her feet for most of her work day.  Prior to the accident, she used to do a lot of clients but the pandemic hurt her business.  She was closed for the pandemic and she reopened her business in May 2020.  In May 2020, she does not know how many clients she would do in a day.  She does not know how many hours she would work in the day.  She was ½ on unemployment and ½ working.  In may 2020, she was not working more than 5 hours a day.  She missed 1 week from work as a result of the accident.  When she went back to work, her daughter had to drive her to work, and she had to use a scooter.  She did her same job but using the scooter.  She could not shampoo clients because she could not get behind the sink.  She used the scooter for 3 and half months.  
She received partial unemployment for about 1 year.  She stopped receiving unemployment in Sept 2021 or 2020, she is unsure.  She cannot say if her income was effected in any way because of the pandemic.

She wears glasses to see up close for reading.  She gets them at the dollar store.  She had her eyes checked by a doctor, maybe Cohen’s Fashion Optical in the Mall.  The last time she was there was 2 years ago.

She resided in a basement apartment.  She entered through a staircase in the backyard.  The apt was a 2 bedroom, storage room, kitchen, hallway, bathroom and washer and dryer.  There was another staircase that went into the house that other tenants lived in.  Her normal means of egress was the outside staircase.  There was a screen door and kitchen door.  The screen door opened out toward the staircase.  The solid door opened into the apt.  There were approx. 6-7 stairs leading to the apt.  They were made of brick.  There was a landing on the bottom made out of ceramic tile.  The landing was maybe 3-4 feet.  The landing at the top of the stairs was either cement or brick.  The last 2 steps above the bottom landing tilted down from back to front, and the landing was concave because it was cracked.  Prior to the accident, she would leave her apt 1-2x a day.  She would use the staircase between 2-4x a day, plus the 2 times a day that she fed the cats.   

Her roommate Thomas would do maintenance work around the apt.  He thought he was the superintendent of the apt. He installed the screen door, installed camera. He took the camera when he left, along with the ring doorbell when he left.  He moved out in July 2020.  

She was involved in an accident on 1/23/21 at the premises.  She was going down the steps, when her foot rolled on the last step and the landing.  Her right ankle rolled on the last step going to the landing.  Her left foot was in the air going down to the landing.  She then specifically said that her right ankle rolled on the last step.  Her right foot was in the middle of the step when her right ankle rolled.  Her body was toward to the left side of the door as she’s facing the door.  Her right and left foot were on the last step together. When she lifted her left foot and put it down on the landing, her right ankle rolled on the step.  She was carrying empty cap bowls in both hands.  Just prior to the accident, she went up the steps and was coming back down when the accident occurred.  

The landlord had told her to get out because she asked the landlord to fix the oven.  She stopped paying rent prior to the accident because her oven was broken and there was damage from the cesspool.  Her rent was $600 at the t/a.  

She had 2 glasses of wine Friday night with her dinner.  She smokes marijuana but was out of it on the day of the accident. She does not recall when she last smoked marijuana prior to the accident.  

She had observed the defects with the steps prior to the accident.  She never made any complaints about the stairs to the landlord.  She was aware of the condition of the steps from going up and down them several times a day.  She was taking precautions walking down the steps by taking the most safe route down the stairs.  The screen door was open at the t/a and so was the interior solid door.  The tilted down steps caused her ankle to roll. She then fell forward on her hands and her knees.  She fell forward into the kitchen of the apt.  Both hands hit the ground and her right knee.  

She yelled help to the people upstair, Jessica and Daryl.  They came down and called an ambulance.

The ambulance arrived.  She told them that she fell down the stairs in the landing area.  She c/o pain to her right ankle.  She was taken to LI Community Hospital.  They did xrays and told her she had a fractured ankle and that she needed to see an orthopedist.  She was given crutches.

She went a few days later to see Dr. Kormylo.  She c/o of pain in her right ankle.  He performed xrays and told her that she needed surgery on her FX ankle.  She had surgery on 1/30/21.  The put her bones back together and put in screws and a plate. A hard cast was put on her ankle.  She was then put in a boot.  After three and half months, she went to PT. 

In between the accident and the surgery, she went to work one day using a scooter for her leg.  She stayed home the rest of the days.  

She saw her cardiologist before the surgery to get clearance.  She has mitral valve prolapse. 

She went to Provident PT in Medford 3x a week for 6 months.  Then insurance would not cover it during that year 2021 so she stopped for 3-4 months.  The following year she did another 6 months.  Then the insurance refused to pay more so she stopped treatment.  She was given exercises to do at home.  

She had an MRI of her foot after the surgery at Zwanger Pesiri because she felt like there something in between her toes.  She was referred by Dr. Kormylo.

Further injections and surgery was recommended by Dr. Kormylo.  He recommended removal of the hardware and cleaning out scar tissue.  She has not had the surgery.  She would like to get it if ever she could take off of work.  

She consulted with an atty the same week of the accident.
In 2014, she suffered broken ribs because she was pushed by an ex boyfriend.  No other accidents.  No prior injuries.  

In 2021, after she stopped wearing her boot, she reinjured her right ankle after the accident because her right ankle rolled. She was walking up a curb into a driveway at the salon.  She went back to Dr. Kormylo.  He did xrays.  Her ankle was fine.  Dr. Kormylo recommended injections.  She did not have them because she did not feel they would help.  Her ankle was healing when this ankle occurred.  She had just started to walk without the boot and PT.  This accident did not make her ankle worse.  

She applied for SSD in 2016 for depression, back pain, fibromyalgia.  She did not use an attorney.  She was not approved.  

Activities-
Cannot do – cannot run, dance.  
Limited – working.  At the end of the day, her ankle swells.  

Her right ankle freezes at night and she needs a cane to walk to the bathroom.  Her pain is 1/10.  Her ankle feels stiff right now.  

Out of pocket expenses – Scooter $275, new car to fit the scooter in.  She bought a Kia Nero for 25k when she traded in her BMW.  

Liens – she does not know

She went to CT in 2022 for a concert, Ginger.  No vacas since the d/a.

Confinement to bed – a few days 
Confinement to home – whenever there were snow storms because the landlord did not shovel.  

Def A – it shows the area.  But it does not show the angle of the steps being tilted.  On the bottom step, in between the 6th and the 7th brick from the right, if where her ankle rolled.  Her foot was either on the 6th or 7th brick or a combination.
Def B – hard to tell that there’s a slant in the steps.  But it is the location on the day of the accident.  Fair and accurate.  Her foot was on the first step.  This looks like her foot was on the 3 or 4th brick.  She believes the bricks that her foot stepped on are depicted in the photos but she cannot tell exactly where.
Def C – not fair and accurate because you cannot see the tilt in the steps.  The brick her right foot was on is depicted in the photo.  Her foot was on the 4th and 5th brick from the right side of the photo on the bottom steps.
Def D – shows how the cats would normally sit on the steps.  

No cats were on the steps when the accident occurred.  In 2020, the cats would sit on the wall of the steps.   

Her scar on her right akle is about 3 and a half inches long.  It makes her less attractive.  People have said “ewww” to her scar before.

EBT MEMO
7/20/23

Gina Covello
D/A: 1/23/21

Reporter US Legal – Justin Ortiz - ortijust26@gmail.com
Def Atty – Louis Imbroto - limbroto@milbermakris.com

She has been known by the a/k/a Gina Martine for her work.  She lives with her daughter, Chelsea, at her current address.  She has a grandson that lives with the dad in CT.  

Prior to her current apt, she lived at 178 West Yaphank Road, Coram.  She lived there from 4/1/2020 through ________.  She had an Asian, male roommate for 3 months, Thomas Graphio. He moved out due to an issue with the cesspool.  He lived there before her.  He moved out in July 2020.   Her daughter stayed with her in March of 2021, after that accident, to help her.  She stayed until they both left.  

There was a colony of cats in the backyard, approx. 30.  They were feral cats.  She would take care of the cats.  She started in July/Aug of 2020.  She told the landlord that she had them all fixed, neutered and spayed.  The cats were going through the garbage cans so she started giving them food.  She fed them 2x a day.  She would feed them wet and dry food.  Before her injury, she fed them by an outside table and chairs.  After her accident, she had to feed them on the steps because she could not get up the steps.  She used maybe 6 bowls in the beginning to feed the cats.  At the end, she was using 15 bowls.  

She went to Boces and got a cosmetology degree.  She filed bankruptcy in 1993 and in 2010.

She weighs 160 pounds now.  She gained weight after the accident because her activities were limited.  She could not lift weights or run.  Prior to the accident she went to the gym 3x per week.  She was a member from Bev Fitness Gold gym in Syosset, which closed, and Planet Fitness in Centereach.  She was also a member of Bev Fitness in Garden City.  She was not a member of a gym on the d/a.  She is not a member of a gym now.  She’s a yellow belt in Kempo karate.  She used to loved to dance, but she cannot wear heels, so ow she dances barefoot.  She last danced 2-3 years ago.  

PCP – Dr. Arif.
Her health insurance is Health First through ObamaCare

Facebook – Ginapastina is her username
Instagram – Gina3944 – she only uses for work pictures. 
She deleted Ticktock and Twitter.  She cannot recall her usernames anymore, as its been years.  

She is currently employed.  Tru Salon in St. James, and she is self employed at VS1 Salon in Great Neck.  She has worked at Tru salon since Sept 2021.  She has worked at VS1 for 9 years.
On the d/a, she worked at VS1.   She is a master colorist.  She does not work more than 5 hours in a day because of her ankle.  By the end of the day her ankle is swollen.  She is on her feet for most of her work day.  Prior to the accident, she used to do a lot of clients but the pandemic hurt her business.  She was closed for the pandemic and she reopened her business in May 2020.  In May 2020, she does not know how many clients she would do in a day.  She does not know how many hours she would work in the day.  She was ½ on unemployment and ½ working.  In may 2020, she was not working more than 5 hours a day.  She missed 1 week from work as a result of the accident.  When she went back to work, her daughter had to drive her to work, and she had to use a scooter.  She did her same job but using the scooter.  She could not shampoo clients because she could not get behind the sink.  She used the scooter for 3 and half months.  
She received partial unemployment for about 1 year.  She stopped receiving unemployment in Sept 2021 or 2020, she is unsure.  She cannot say if her income was effected in any way because of the pandemic.

She wears glasses to see up close for reading.  She gets them at the dollar store.  She had her eyes checked by a doctor, maybe Cohen’s Fashion Optical in the Mall.  The last time she was there was 2 years ago.

She resided in a basement apartment.  She entered through a staircase in the backyard.  The apt was a 2 bedroom, storage room, kitchen, hallway, bathroom and washer and dryer.  There was another staircase that went into the house that other tenants lived in.  Her normal means of egress was the outside staircase.  There was a screen door and kitchen door.  The screen door opened out toward the staircase.  The solid door opened into the apt.  There were approx. 6-7 stairs leading to the apt.  They were made of brick.  There was a landing on the bottom made out of ceramic tile.  The landing was maybe 3-4 feet.  The landing at the top of the stairs was either cement or brick.  The last 2 steps above the bottom landing tilted down from back to front, and the landing was concave because it was cracked.  Prior to the accident, she would leave her apt 1-2x a day.  She would use the staircase between 2-4x a day, plus the 2 times a day that she fed the cats.   

Her roommate Thomas would do maintenance work around the apt.  He thought he was the superintendent of the apt. He installed the screen door, installed camera. He took the camera when he left, along with the ring doorbell when he left.  He moved out in July 2020.  

She was involved in an accident on 1/23/21 at the premises.  She was going down the steps, when her foot rolled on the last step and the landing.  Her right ankle rolled on the last step going to the landing.  Her left foot was in the air going down to the landing.  She then specifically said that her right ankle rolled on the last step.  Her right foot was in the middle of the step when her right ankle rolled.  Her body was toward to the left side of the door as she’s facing the door.  Her right and left foot were on the last step together. When she lifted her left foot and put it down on the landing, her right ankle rolled on the step.  She was carrying empty cap bowls in both hands.  Just prior to the accident, she went up the steps and was coming back down when the accident occurred.  

The landlord had told her to get out because she asked the landlord to fix the oven.  She stopped paying rent prior to the accident because her oven was broken and there was damage from the cesspool.  Her rent was $600 at the t/a.  

She had 2 glasses of wine Friday night with her dinner.  She smokes marijuana but was out of it on the day of the accident. She does not recall when she last smoked marijuana prior to the accident.  

She had observed the defects with the steps prior to the accident.  She never made any complaints about the stairs to the landlord.  She was aware of the condition of the steps from going up and down them several times a day.  She was taking precautions walking down the steps by taking the most safe route down the stairs.  The screen door was open at the t/a and so was the interior solid door.  The tilted down steps caused her ankle to roll. She then fell forward on her hands and her knees.  She fell forward into the kitchen of the apt.  Both hands hit the ground and her right knee.  

She yelled help to the people upstair, Jessica and Daryl.  They came down and called an ambulance.

The ambulance arrived.  She told them that she fell down the stairs in the landing area.  She c/o pain to her right ankle.  She was taken to LI Community Hospital.  They did xrays and told her she had a fractured ankle and that she needed to see an orthopedist.  She was given crutches.

She went a few days later to see Dr. Kormylo.  She c/o of pain in her right ankle.  He performed xrays and told her that she needed surgery on her FX ankle.  She had surgery on 1/30/21.  The put her bones back together and put in screws and a plate. A hard cast was put on her ankle.  She was then put in a boot.  After three and half months, she went to PT. 

In between the accident and the surgery, she went to work one day using a scooter for her leg.  She stayed home the rest of the days.  

She saw her cardiologist before the surgery to get clearance.  She has mitral valve prolapse. 

She went to Provident PT in Medford 3x a week for 6 months.  Then insurance would not cover it during that year 2021 so she stopped for 3-4 months.  The following year she did another 6 months.  Then the insurance refused to pay more so she stopped treatment.  She was given exercises to do at home.  

She had an MRI of her foot after the surgery at Zwanger Pesiri because she felt like there something in between her toes.  She was referred by Dr. Kormylo.

Further injections and surgery was recommended by Dr. Kormylo.  He recommended removal of the hardware and cleaning out scar tissue.  She has not had the surgery.  She would like to get it if ever she could take off of work.  

She consulted with an atty the same week of the accident.
In 2014, she suffered broken ribs because she was pushed by an ex boyfriend.  No other accidents.  No prior injuries.  

In 2021, after she stopped wearing her boot, she reinjured her right ankle after the accident because her right ankle rolled. She was walking up a curb into a driveway at the salon.  She went back to Dr. Kormylo.  He did xrays.  Her ankle was fine.  Dr. Kormylo recommended injections.  She did not have them because she did not feel they would help.  Her ankle was healing when this ankle occurred.  She had just started to walk without the boot and PT.  This accident did not make her ankle worse.  

She applied for SSD in 2016 for depression, back pain, fibromyalgia.  She did not use an attorney.  She was not approved.  

Activities-
Cannot do – cannot run, dance.  
Limited – working.  At the end of the day, her ankle swells.  

Her right ankle freezes at night and she needs a cane to walk to the bathroom.  Her pain is 1/10.  Her ankle feels stiff right now.  

Out of pocket expenses – Scooter $275, new car to fit the scooter in.  She bought a Kia Nero for 25k when she traded in her BMW.  

Liens – she does not know

She went to CT in 2022 for a concert, Ginger.  No vacas since the d/a.

Confinement to bed – a few days 
Confinement to home – whenever there were snow storms because the landlord did not shovel.  

Def A – it shows the area.  But it does not show the angle of the steps being tilted.  On the bottom step, in between the 6th and the 7th brick from the right, if where her ankle rolled.  Her foot was either on the 6th or 7th brick or a combination.
Def B – hard to tell that there’s a slant in the steps.  But it is the location on the day of the accident.  Fair and accurate.  Her foot was on the first step.  This looks like her foot was on the 3 or 4th brick.  She believes the bricks that her foot stepped on are depicted in the photos but she cannot tell exactly where.
Def C – not fair and accurate because you cannot see the tilt in the steps.  The brick her right foot was on is depicted in the photo.  Her foot was on the 4th and 5th brick from the right side of the photo on the bottom steps.
Def D – shows how the cats would normally sit on the steps.  

No cats were on the steps when the accident occurred.  In 2020, the cats would sit on the wall of the steps.   

Her scar on her right akle is about 3 and a half inches long.  It makes her less attractive.  People have said “ewww” to her scar before.
